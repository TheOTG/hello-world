hello-world
===========

Hi there.

I'm new to github and it would be nice if anyone would spent some of their time teaching me.
I saw that github offers unreal engine 4 for free as long as I'm still a student so why not lol.
Currently taking my bachelors in IT, learning python in my school, I'm thinking of learning C++ as well
since unreal engine 4 uses C++
